# Define churn based on the rules:

# - satisfaction score < 5

def predict_churn(row):
    if row['purchase_frequency'] in ['rare', 'occasional'] or row['satisfaction_score'] < 5:
        return 1  # Churn
    else:
        return 0  # Not churn

# Apply the rule to create a new 'churn' column
customer_data['churn'] = customer_data.apply(predict_churn, axis=1)
